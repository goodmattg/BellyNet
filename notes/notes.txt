Start by training global pose normalization. What is the output format of DensePoseNet? Doesn't it return a mesh on a static image?

List of things I think we'll need to do.
    - Get DensePoseNet installed onto the server
    - Looks like we'll be using DensePoseNet to generate IUV images for each frame? Where I seems to be segmentation
        and UV is some sort of projection from the 2D image to a 3D surface
    - Make sure the semantic label representation is what we expect (coordinates on a 2D grid right in x,y,depth channels?) 
    - Train global
    - Train local
    -
